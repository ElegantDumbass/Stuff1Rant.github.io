              Generally, my favourite sort of literature (and graphic literature) is stuff of heft and weight—reading that requires and rewards thoughtful interaction. I loved Bolaño’s Savage Detectives, Julian Barnes’ Sense of an Ending,
              Tom McCarthy’s Remainder. I reward books like Duncan the Wonder Dog and Nao of Brown with high spots on my Top Comics list. <br />
              <br />
              And at this point there’s not really any sense bothering to ask, Do I like these kinds of books because they are the best books or do I like these kinds of books because I want to be the kind of person who likes these kinds of
              books? By now, it hardly matters. Whether there was any kind of pretension in my initial interest in thoughtful books, they’ve long since become my preferred playground in the medium. It’s one of these I-yam-what-I-yam sorts
              of things. Irrevocable, probably. <br> <br>
              But every now and then, I run counter to the programming and really just want something fun to occupy myself. Something light, something thrilling. Something entirely plot-driven. Something… not pregnant with meaning. <br><br>
              or a long time, I tied my long-waned interest in superhero books to the fact that they were ultimately low-value trifles. They were, mostly, just dumb fun books—and who has time for that when there are more solid, worthwhile graphic novels out there than any of us will ever have time to read? But I was wrong. I misplaced the origin of my distaste for superheroes. It didn’t have anything to do with their plot-driven sensationalism. After all, I adore Korean dramas, don’t I? The trick with Marvel’s and DC’s hero books is that they don’t feature characters so much as they forward story-engines.[1] Where characters have arcs and growth and progression, the whole point of Spider-Man or Batman is to tell Spider-Man or Batman stories. They can never be allowed to stray from archetype because they are not characters, but product generators. That’s why I couldn’t stay invested. There was nothing to invest in. There’re only so many times that you can read the biographies of Abraham Lincoln before you—for your own sanity probably—have to move on to other biographies, to other persons.
